# memssh

`memssh` is a lightweight SSH client wrapper built to address a specific issue: **OpenSSH blocks SSH keys stored in insecure locations** (such as world-readable folders or custom password managers). This tool allows interactive or command-based SSH access using a pasted private key, bypassing strict file permission checks while still performing secure host verification and fingerprint pinning.

## ‚ú® Features

- Connects to SSH servers using a private key passed via argument or stdin
- Secure fingerprint verification with user confirmation
- Stores known hosts and their fingerprints in a local `.known_hosts.json` file
- Supports command execution or full interactive shells
- Handles encrypted private keys with passphrase prompts
- Works well in restricted environments (e.g., when `.ssh/` cannot be used)

## üîß Why It Exists

Standard `ssh` rejects keys that aren‚Äôt stored securely on disk. This can be frustrating in environments where:

- You store keys in secure password managers or hardware tokens
- You can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to use the default `~/.ssh` directory
- You run in restricted containers, CI/CD environments, or minimal systems

`memssh` solves this by allowing you to paste a key or pass it as a flag, with secure handling and ephemeral memory wiping after use.

## üöÄ Usage

### Install dependencies

Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or later recommended). Then fetch the dependencies:

```bash
go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh
go get golang.org/x/term
```

### Build

```bash
go build -o memssh
```

### Run

```bash
./memssh -host example.com -user ubuntu
```

Or with a pasted key:

```bash
./memssh -host example.com -user ubuntu
Paste your private key (end with an empty line):
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

You can also pass the key via `-key` flag:

```bash
./memssh -host example.com -user ubuntu -key "/path/to/key"
```

To run a command instead of an interactive shell:

```bash
./memssh -host example.com -user ubuntu -cmd "uptime"
```

Disable saving of host fingerprints with:

```bash
./memssh -host example.com -user ubuntu -no-store
```

## üóÇ Known Hosts Storage

Fingerprint trust is stored locally in `.known_hosts.json` in the **same directory as the compiled binary**. This file maps `host:port` ‚Üí `SHA256 fingerprint`. If a fingerprint changes, you're prompted to accept the new one.

## üîê Security Notes

- Keys are zeroed from memory after use.
- Passphrases are not stored.
- Only SHA256 fingerprints are used for verification.
- Interactive trust confirmation is required for unknown or changed hosts.
